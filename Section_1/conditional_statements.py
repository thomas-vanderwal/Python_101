#Chapter 4: Conditional statements
# Like most languages, python supports an if/elif/else type statement
# However, it doesn't support CASE/SWITCH :(

if 2 > 1:
    print('This is a true statement')

#Note the indented spaces. This is what tells python to run code within a statement (like {})
#  4 spaces is recommended as a python standard but any number will work as long as
#  the programmer is consistent
