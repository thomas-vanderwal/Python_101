#import this  #This module is an easter egg that shows best practices of python
import math
print(math.sqrt(4))

#You can specify particular modules using from ie: from math import sqrt. You will no longer need the leading math. to call sqrt
#Another way to import is using * which imports all modules. This is considered bad practice because you can clobber
#An object you've created with one from the module
